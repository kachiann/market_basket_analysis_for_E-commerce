## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
### Understanding Market Basket Analysis
Market basket analysis is a strategic tool employed by businesses such as restaurants, retail stores, and online shopping platforms to boost customer spending during a single shopping session. This application of data science in marketing plays a pivotal role in enhancing company revenues and fostering business expansion. Here is a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umairaslam/grocery/download) available on Kaggle. 

## Tools <a name="tools"></a>
* Data Analysis Tools: Python (using libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/))
* Data Visualization Tools: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Sklearn](https://sklearn.org/)

## Project Objective<a name="objective"></a>
The objective of this project is to familiarize you with market basket analysis, a vital component of data science in retail and e-commerce. Through this project, you'll acquire the skills to extract valuable insights from transaction data, comprehend customer purchasing behavior, and leverage this knowledge for business optimization.
To do this we will do the following: 
- Create a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Identify products frequently purchased together.
- Construct recommendations based on these findings
- Explore advanced visualization techniques.
